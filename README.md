# REGEX ENGINE
# About
In this project, we will write an extendable regex engine that can handle
basic regex syntax, including literals (a,b,c, etc), wild-cards (.), and
metacharacters(?, *, +, ^, $).  
The `re` module don't need to be used in this project.
# Description
1. Single character strings  
   Build a function that can compare a single character regex to a single
   character input string-
2. Matching two equal length strings  
   Extend the function to handle regex-string pairs of equal length.
3. Working with strings of different length
4. Implementing the operators `^` and `$`
5. Controlling repetition with operators `?`, `*`, and `+`
6. Escaping `\`
